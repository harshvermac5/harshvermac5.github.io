            <div class="box" style="text-align: left;">
              <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I hope you are all doing well and having a great week. Once again, I extend a warm welcome to join me on my technical journey.</p>

<p>Starting with some good news, I have recently completed the <strong>"AI for Everyone"</strong> course by <strong>Andrew Ng</strong> on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone?utm_source=deeplearningai&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=WebsiteCoursesAI4ETopButton" style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 132, 255);" >Coursera</a>. I have also signed up for their newsletter. It's wonderful to stay connected with such an influential figure. The best part is, you can audit the course for free, although assessments are not accessible. Nonetheless, I am excited to share my notes on LinkedIn. I've attached screenshots of answers for verification. You can view the post <a href="link">here</a> and consider reposting if you find it valuable, to help it reach more people.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I am approximately one-fifth of the way through the <strong>"Packet Capture"</strong> course using Wireshark by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidbombal/" style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 132, 255);">David Bombal<a/>. I am thrilled with how smoothly I am progressing through the troubleshooting labs. It seems my preparation for CCNA is paying off. I can't wait to share more details once I complete the course.</p>

<p>For the first time, I posted an infographic on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/harshvermac5_demilitarized-zone-activity-7162028121020452864-VjcR?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop"style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 132, 255);">LinkedIn</a>, focusing on <strong>DMZ</strong> (Demilitarized Zone). Just to recap, it serves as a security buffer between public and private networks, safeguarding the critical inside network from external threats, such as the Internet. I'm delighted that it received positive feedback from my connections. Stay tuned, as I plan to share more infographics soon. <strong>*SPOILER ALERT*</strong> Next, I'll be posting an infographic about Honeypots in the network.</p>

<p>I would love to hear from you too. Feel free to connect and share with me. Your contributions are greatly appreciated.</p>

            </label>

            <div class="box" style="text-align: left;">
              <p>Hello, fantastic readers! ðŸŒŸ<p>
              </p> What a ride this week has been, and I'm thrilled to have you join me on this journey.</p>
              <p>So, my week kicked off with a deep dive into a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/wireshark-packet-analysis-and-ethical-hacking-core-skills/learn/lecture/15144294?start=0#announcements"style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 132, 255);"><strong>course on network analysis using Wireshark</strong></a> â€“ blame it on that persistent Temptation. Thanks to Sir <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@davidbombal" style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 132, 255);"><strong>David Bombal's YouTube channel</strong></a>, I stumbled upon Udemy coupon codes and snagged a Wireshark course, possibly for free! There, I learned about two kinds of filters that Wireshark offers: one for capturing the traffic and the other for scrutinizing it. And voila, it also comes with a filtered traffic follow mode, showing all the related traffic at one place at once.</p>
              
              <p>Let's talk coding adventures! Curiosity struck again, leading me to the <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/en/learn/courses/sql-introduction" style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 132, 255);"><strong>SoloLearn</strong></a> app for a date with <strong>SQL</strong>. After mastering Python, SQL feels like a breeze, and I'm eagerly awaiting the day I can seamlessly blend the two. This website also needs a breeze of SQL too.</p>
              
              <p>Moreover, <strong>GitHub</strong> became my creative playground. I created a new repository â€“ <strong>Python by Example challenges</strong>. This is based on the challenges found in the book "<strong>Python by Example</strong>" by Nichola Lacey. I know the book has the solutions, but I enjoy solving them on my own; you can check out my progress and code by <a href="https://github.com/harshvermac5/python-by-example" style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 132, 255);">clicking <strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
              
              <p>From Feb 1 onwards, I also started to look for jobs on <strong>LinkedIn</strong> with a target of at least 2-3 applications per day. I duly follow the words of Sir Ankur Wariko, "<strong>Cold Emailing</strong>": Whenever possible, I try to connect with the recruiter. This has paid off great so far. Now I have connections with most of my CCNA tutors. Last night, I got connected with a Python developer who has created an impressive image recognition project; you can also follow and connect with him <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/khushank73/" style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 132, 255);"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
              
              <p>In my job search hustle, I took advice from Sir Jeff Su, which was making a <strong>targeted resume with the help of gpt-Prompt</strong>. This help alone is miraculous, and when backed by all the effort I put into improving myself, it seems great. He duly warned me to check for the hallucinations the chat GPT makes, so I check my resume twice before posting. If any recruiter reading this post, please reach out to me at my email. I will be glad and totally open to work as a <strong>Junior Network Engineer or as a Network Technician</strong> for your firm.</p>
              
              <p>All good so far, but the Temptation also brings the anxiety of starting too much at once but completing none. For this also, I made a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/harshvermac5_achievefocus-fromchaostocalm-lifewisdom-activity-7159273283018776576-Iiy9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop" style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 132, 255);"><strong>LinkedIn</strong></a> expressing the need to cope with this scenario. One thing more I want to share: since I started to listen to <strong>classical music</strong>, the majority of my anxiety fades away. Do try this trick and tell me, does it also work for you?</p>
              
              <p>Now, time to talk about the plans for the future. I am planning to start posting some <strong>Cisco Packet Tracer labs on GitHub</strong>, but I am limiting myself until I finish every challenge in the <strong>Python-by-Example</strong> book. I have a plan to make the labs so polished that no one needs to buy any premium things to pass <strong>CCNA</strong>. I will try to match the quality of labs to those questions asked in the exam. ðŸš€ #WeeklyUpdate #LearningJourney #TechAdventures</p>

His expertise alleviated my apprehensions about code manipulation, introducing me to essential elements such as the <strong>Local Host extension</strong> and <strong>anchor tags</strong>. The website, rooted in the open-source project <strong>Dopefolio</strong> by the generous developer <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://rammaheshwari.com">Ram Maheshwari</a></strong>, now proudly resides on my GitHub page, showcasing a collection of my endeavors.

                  Reflecting on this journey, memories of my attempts to create a website during my Intermediate years, nearly 4-5 years ago, come to mind. Those early endeavors ended in failure, but today, with the support of friends and the ever-evolving user-friendly technology, achieving wonders like this website is within everyone's grasp. Gratitude for progress, growth, and the collaborative spirit that makes such accomplishments possible. Explore my works on my GitHub page, and thank you for being part of this journey.

                  <p >
                    As you may know, I'm preparing for the <strong>CCNA examination</strong>, which is a certification that validates my knowledge and skills in <strong>network engineering</strong> and <strong>security</strong>. It's a tough exam, but I'm determined to ace it.
                </p>
                
                <p >
                    One of the ways I'm studying for the exam is by creating <strong>YouTube videos</strong>, mainly audio form recordings, where I explain the concepts and topics covered in the <strong>CCNA syllabus</strong>. I have a passion for sharing educational content with you all, and I believe that teaching is the best way to learn.
                </p>
                
                <p >
                    I was inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyzf9_LUFN-2Xr30z8hyW1A" style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 132, 255);"><strong>Puneet Biseria</strong></a> who is a great teacher and a mentor for me. He once said that you only grasp a hold of something if you are able to teach others. That resonated with me, and I decided to follow his advice.
                </p>
                
                <p >
                    I have a target of creating a set of 12 videos, covering the main domains of the <strong>CCNA exam</strong>. You can find them on my YouTube playlist for <strong>CCNA</strong>. I'm currently on the fourth video, where I talk about <strong>network access</strong> and <strong>security</strong>.
                </p>
                
                <p >
                    I know that the audio quality is not very good on the first few videos, but I hope you can bear with me. I'm still learning how to use the software and the microphone, and I'm trying to improve with each video. I appreciate your feedback and suggestions on how to make my videos better.
                </p>
                
                <p >
                    I'm also aware that it was the end of the year when I started this project, and everyone was celebrating the new year. But I was so focused on my goal that I didn't mind spending hours on my computer, recording and editing my videos. I had a mixed feeling of happiness and tension, as I was excited about sharing my knowledge with you, but also nervous about the upcoming exam.
                </p>
                
                <p >
                    I did make a special video, where I greeted you and wished you a <strong>happy new year</strong>. You can watch it <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/eUZSuhANzwo?feature=share" style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 132, 255);"><strong>here</strong>.</a> I hope you enjoyed it and felt my gratitude and appreciation for your support and encouragement.
                </p>
                
                <p >
                    That's all for today. Thank you for reading my blog and watching my videos. I hope you learned something new and useful from them. I would love to hear from you! Your thoughts and feedback help me grow and improve my blog and my videos. Please share your comments below.
