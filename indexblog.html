                <p>Hey everyone, welcome to another week where I continue sharing my journey! Voila!</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Good Part</strong></p>
                
                <p>I joined Tech Mahindra as a BPO trainee! It’s a unique story, and I’ll definitely share more details soon.</p>
                
                <p>My job search was quite desperate. I was constantly seeking referrals from distant connections, but that didn't yield much success. So, I turned to walk-in interviews. I was testing myself, grappling with <em>imposter syndrome</em>, and trying to prove my capabilities.</p>
                
                <p>One day, my friend Snehil and I attended a walk-in interview at Tech Mahindra. Snehil was also affected by a layoff due to issues with his previous startup. During the interview, we faced 7 rounds in one day. Our mindset was to give it our all, fearing failure if we didn't succeed. The interview focused on English speaking, narration, listening, summarizing, and speaking skills. Although I had studied technical topics for years, there were no technical questions. To my relief, I breezed through all the rounds, thanks to my teaching experience. Unfortunately, Snehil couldn't clear the interview due to difficulties in explaining the extempore.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Not-So-Good Part</strong></p>
                
                <p>I didn't get the exact position I aimed for. Having no prior BPO experience, I found it challenging to understand my new role. My friend explained that BPO involves taking client calls and facilitating their business processes. Even after the interview, I was uncertain about what lay ahead.</p>
                
                <p><strong>What's Next?</strong></p>
                
                <p>I'm considering asking Tech Mahindra to let me volunteer in their IT department. I'm inspired by Chuck Keith’s interview on David Bombal’s YouTube channel, where he shared his journey to IT, moving "<em>from selling toilets to IT</em>." His story inspired me to pursue Switching and Routing in IT. His dedication led to a promotion as a Junior Network Engineer, and I'm hopeful my path will lead to similar opportunities.</p>
                
                <p>That’s all for this week. Thank you for your time and patience!</p>

            </label>
            <div class="box" style="text-align: left;">
              <p><strong>Hello, dear reader!</strong><br>
               Welcome to the <em>not so wholesome summary</em> of my week.</p>

              <p>Over the past week here in Delhi, much of my time has been consumed by filling out countless job applications. Despite the effort, I'm yet to see any results. The job search can indeed be quite frustrating, especially when transitioning from finance to IT, as I have chosen to do, with a focus on Routing and Switching as inspired by figures like Sir Jeremy McDowell and Chuck Keith. However, it's important to note that certain factors vary depending on one's location.</p>
              
              <p>Yesterday, I attended a <strong>Scalar</strong> webinar, where <strong>Google</strong> and <strong>Microsoft</strong> employees shared their insights on entering the realms of <strong><em>AI and Machine Learning</em></strong>.<br> The discussion gradually shifted to the current market dynamics and demands in India. I was surprised to know that <strong><em>AI and Machine Learning</em></strong> have roots dating back to the <strong>90s</strong>, it wasn't until around 2015 that computers became powerful enough to effectively execute these algorithms at scale. At its core, <strong><em>AI and Machine Learning</em></strong> often boil down to a series of if-else statements trained over robust algorithm to draw meaningful conclusions.</p>
              
              <p>From a financial perspective, not every company has the resources to maintain these models internally. Many opt to leverage APIs for a fee instead. Regarding job markets, while there is a growing demand for Machine Learning Engineers, the ratio suggests that only about one in ten companies require them. <br>This parallels the situation with Cybersecurity analysts, where the buzz around certain skills often outweighs the actual demand in the job market. This is because software engineers often acquire foundational knowledge in these areas themselves.</p>
              
              <p>In conclusion, the job market still heavily favors Backend Engineers who are adept at upskilling themselves and utilizing AI to enhance their abilities. As the host also told, even mid to large-size companies like Scalar lack specialized security branches. So, what's the next step? Upskill yourself. Recognizing my own need to adopt an engineer's mindset and build upon available resources, I've embarked on learning Backend development, starting with Javascript. For this, I've turned to <strong>Shreiyans Coding School</strong>, a comprehensive YouTube channel that focuses on teaching the essentials in a memorable manner. As soon as this blog is posted, I'll be diving back into their playlist.</p>
              
              <p>Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I look forward to sharing more with you next week.</p>

            </label>
            <div class="box" style="text-align: left;">
              <p>Greetings everyone,</p>

<p>Writing this blog on <strong>07 April 2024</strong>, just after joining Zolo Housing as a PG (Paying Guest). It's been a <em>pleasant</em> week so far, and I've totally felt the rush of commuting in Delhi.</p>

<p>I have a lot to tell you today, and I hope you will enjoy it when I pour my heart out.</p>

<p>Let's break the topics down into bullets first:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>1. I attended two interviews.</li>
  <li>2. I met a perfect person.</li>
  <li>3. I made new friends.</li>
</ul>


<p>Hurrah, sounds like fun, but those interviews were not for me... The question is, why did I go there? Here is the answer, my friend: I applied for the role of System Administrator, keeping in mind my Linux and SQL knowledge. Luckily, HR from both interviews told me that there was a vacant position... until I arrived there. They said the position had already been filled by this morning. I felt a little bit scammed, as just minutes before the interview, I talked to HR. It may be the fault of HR that they are uninformed about the current staff positions of the company, or it may be a trap to lure likely candidates with the promise of an available position. Maybe... as the available position was for Calling for Sales of Cards and as a content writer, and in both places, the interviewer never hesitated to provoke me to opt for those jobs. I decided not to, as both don't align with my goals at all.</p>

<p>Time for another story. Guess who the perfect person is? Alright... how would you have known? The philosophy is that perfection is unattainable, but in reality, when something appears to be faultless, we call them perfect. He is someone who has high standards in value, respects and deserves respect, understands, and helps if he can or if needed.</p>

<p>Mr. Shantanu Shankar, none other than the elder brother of my friend Swapnil/Snehil Shankar. He currently resides in Gurgaon, and yesterday we visited him to catch up on the weekend... internally, I was hoping that he would talk to me, as he always has been on the outskirts. This was the time we opened up. He, along with five more members, poured their hearts out; we sang, danced, talked... something like a bonfire camping event. The party was like one from 1999. There, I learned that he is the guy who had a car with his own earnings at just 22 years old, which is a lot from where I belong. He is not bragging; actually, the whole crew was so impressed with him that they were sharing their experiences with him. I feel like there is a great lack of words to explain how wholesome that moment was.</p>

<p>This morning, he advised me about the current job market, saying that you have to keep three months as a buffer period for the job hunt. He said that human psychology involves traits of depression if nothing is achieved within a desired period of time. He also said to keep applying to companies, taught me how to make a resume, what to say in the interview, and promised me that once I complete these basic steps, he will introduce me to his IT colleague, who will further evaluate my chances of selection.</p>

<p>And the third story has not actually happened but is on its way. Another person is our roommate, who is a pretty decent guy, a reserved kind of person... He hasn't spoken a word since I entered the room. Even though today is Sunday, he is doing some meetings on his laptop, so I don't want to interrupt him. This section will need an update for sure... I'll</p>

<p>Regarding my academics, the week was so busy as hell; the only time I got to learn was about REST APIs, its practical demo regarding Cisco Switches, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, more on MS-DOS/Batch Scripting. I have a lot more to cover... so see you next week.</p>

            </label>
            <div class="box" style="text-align: left;">
              <p>Hello, internet! Welcome to another week of reading. This time, I have a lot to share. Firstly, I'm thrilled to announce that I've completed my <strong>ENCOR syllabus</strong>—an achievement I find quite significant. While I haven't yet made the notes, which will undoubtedly take another week, I mustn't forget about the <strong>flashcards</strong>. However, going through a run-through has definitely enhanced my ability to handle such an extensive syllabus.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, not everything went smoothly this past week. As I mentioned in my previous blog, I'll be moving to Delhi soon, but with three days left, this week has felt rather unstructured for me. It's not that there were any problems at home; rather, it's the environment that's been challenging. I've become accustomed to the comforts of home, and my routine has been significantly disrupted. On the bright side, this disruption has allowed me ample time to make headway in my ENCOR preparation, albeit at the expense of late-night studies in front of the cool air of the cooler, resulting in a much later wake-up time.</p>

<p>My well-scheduled life, which involved waking up at <strong>6</strong>, spending countless hours with my <strong>Kindle</strong>, making arrangements for videos, and tutoring my students, now feels like a distant memory. I can't emphasize enough how much I miss and cherish that routine.</p>

<p>Please keep me in your prayers as I strive to return to a more structured schedule in a corporate environment.</p>

<p>Another thought weighing on my mind is the need for an <strong>AWS certification</strong> to strengthen my position in the job market. I'd appreciate your input on how much priority I should give to this certification—if indeed it should be my next preferred certification.</p>

<p>That's all for this week. See you next week.</p>

<p>Regards.</p>

              <p>Hello, everyone! Warm greetings from my side, and thank you for joining me this week. It's been quite a chaotic one for me, but for good reason. As per our plan, I successfully completed all my home tuitions along with their sessions. The great part? All my students excelled in their studies, which validates my claim of improving academic performance by <strong>25%</strong> compared to the previous period.</p>

<p>Now, back home, facing my newly purchased microphone, it's been a day or two of rehearsal. I've made more than four variations of the video discussing committing on GitHub. However, my pursuit of perfection is proving challenging. Even after multiple recordings, I'm not quite comfortable uploading it to YouTube just yet. It's clear I need to address this swiftly. I'm contemplating starting a streaming schedule next month, as my microphone adeptly handles noise disturbances. <br> This month, however, will be dedicated to celebrating festivals.</p>

<p>Let's delve into my career growth. I recently completed the <strong>21 Python project</strong> journey (inspired by Tech with Tim's video), gaining a comprehensive understanding of various libraries and their applications in Python. From <em>pygame</em> to <em>tqdm</em>, <em>pytube</em> to <em>cryptography</em>, and more, I've carefully commented the code for everyone's benefit, including my future self. Now, I'm curious to delve into <em>PyCharm</em>, <em>Pandas</em>, and <em>TensorFlow</em> to furnish my data science and artificial intelligence skills. Automation's potential to influence my lifestyle excites me greatly.</p>

<p>Regarding ENCOR preparation, it's been a tad sluggish this past week. I've focused on revising rather than learning new things. Would you be interested in live study sessions on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>, or do you think <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch</a> would be a better platform? Recently, I delved into <strong>Wireless Networking</strong> and am currently creating flashcards, which you can find in the resource section of this website.</p>

<p>That's all for now. Until next week, thank you for your time.</p>

            <div class="box" style="text-align: left;">
              <p>Hello, internet! Welcome to another week. This week, I'm celebrating the multiple job offers I've received. Last week, I was delighted to receive numerous calls for tech support roles. However, I couldn't accept due to the requirement for immediate joining in Pune, Coimbatore, or New Delhi. Therefore, I've decided to address this by relocating to my preferred location, <strong>New Delhi</strong>.</p>

<p>I've recently started following <a href="https://github.com/uniqueFire12">Ananya Ganguly</a> on GitHub, whom I discovered through Twitter. I'm truly inspired by her array of projects on GitHub. Now, after completing several projects, my goal for next week is to organize my GitHub profile with separate repositories for each project.</p>

<p>This week, I attempted to learn how to use SSH server on Windows computers. Unfortunately, I encountered issues as the service for starting sshd daemon couldn't be initiated on my PC. So, I opted to spin up a Kali Linux Virtual Box, and I was pleasantly surprised by how straightforward certain tasks are on Linux. The more I familiarize myself with Linux, the more I appreciate it. I'm eagerly awaiting the day when Windows 10 reaches its end-of-life on my PC, at which point I plan to replace it with either <strong>PopOS</strong> or <strong>Fedora</strong>. If ever asked to introduce or advocate for Linux to a newcomer, my response would be: "<strong>It provides the closest possible access to your hardware. With knowledge and skill, there's no limit to what you can achieve.</strong>"</p>

<p>Additionally, I've learned how to commit on GitHub with a specific date using the command '<strong>git commit --date "x days ago" -m "your GitHub message"</strong>'. This feature is incredibly useful, especially if you miss a coding streak. Since I practice coding snippets daily, this functionality aids in establishing familiarity with various coding languages.</p>

<p>Wishing you all the best for the upcoming week!</p>

            <div class="box" style="text-align: left;">
              <p>Welcome to my weekly blog! This week has been filled with exciting developments that I can't wait to share with you all.</p>

<p>Firstly, I had the pleasure of meeting another <strong>Wholesome Developer</strong>, introduced to me by my elder brother. He's a fantastic individual with a strong interest in <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, currently working as a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>. What resonated most with me was his background in <strong>economics</strong>, similar to my own <strong>commerce</strong> background, coupled with his keen interest in technology. Despite his relatively low social media presence, I was intrigued by his innovative thinking, particularly evident in a recent <strong>LinkedIn</strong> post discussing the innovative use of fabric for defense purposes. While his post may not have garnered much attention, I believe his creativity deserves recognition, and I encourage you to follow him on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/5priyanshu111/" style="font-weight: bold; color: #0062b9;" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>Another highlight of the week was scoring a fantastic deal on a <strong>Maono dynamic microphone</strong>, typically retailing at $54 but snagged for around $30 during a <strong>Flipkart</strong> sale. The primary motivation behind this purchase was its superior <strong>noise rejection</strong> compared to its counterpart, the <strong>condenser microphone</strong>. Noise interruptions have been a significant hindrance in my video creation journey, and I've often found myself frustrated by interruptions during takes. This is precisely why I opted for a dynamic microphone over a <strong>lavalier/lapel mic</strong>, as the latter tends to pick up noise from all directions.</p>

<p>With this new addition to my setup, I anticipate a significant increase in my video presence on both of my <strong>YouTube</strong> channels. Be sure to subscribe for upcoming content!</p>

<p>Additionally, I've started creating flashcards and reached upto the main points of BGP, which I'll soon be uploading to the resource section of this website. Stay tuned for updates on that front.</p>

<p>Wishing you all a fantastic week ahead!</p>

              <p>Welcome to my belated blog entry on March 5th, 2024, despite initially targeting the release for March 3rd, 2024. I am currently in good health, and I'd like to express my gratitude to those who may have sent prayers or well wishes for my recovery. I'm feeling much better now.</p>
              <p>Now, let's dive into the updates you're here for. Lately, I've been dedicated to continually improving and learning new things. Recently, I shared a quote on LinkedIn from James Clear's newsletter about the importance of <strong>consistency</strong>. It's worth noting that consistency isn't just about discipline or determination; it's also about adaptability. Blogging, for instance, is one such endeavor that requires consistent effort and adaptability. After months of consistent posting, I've gained a newfound respect for bloggers and their dedication.</p>
              <p>Regarding tools like <strong>ChatGPT</strong>, while they can be helpful for automating certain tasks and proofreading, I believe they lack the authenticity required for genuine conversation. However, I do use such tools to enhance the readability of my blogs, ensuring they are easily digestible for you, the reader.</p>
              <p>Additionally, I've been making efforts to engage more on LinkedIn, despite being an introvert. I've come across individuals like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rubin-patterson-jr-45486460/" style="font-weight: bold; color: #0062b9;" target="_blank"><strong>Rubin Patterson Jr</strong></a>, who consistently support and share valuable insights. I encourage you to connect with him if you're interested in his content.</p>
              <p>Shifting gears, let me share a few thoughts on my <strong>CCNP journey</strong>. While I've found it to be relatively smooth sailing initially, thanks to my previous knowledge of CCNA concepts, I'm now facing new challenges with topics like <strong>BGP parameters</strong>. Nonetheless, I've devised a study plan that involves revising on weekends without introducing new topics on Saturdays and Sundays.</p>
              <p>On the <strong>Python</strong> front, I've embarked on a journey following a 9-hour-long video titled "<strong>21 Python Projects</strong>." Currently, I'm in the early stages, diligently working on each project and enhancing the code as I progress. You can find my code snippets and contributions on my <a href="https://github.com/harshvermac5"style="font-weight: bold; color: #0062b9;" target="_blank">GitHub learning repository</a>.</p>
              <p>Lastly, I've maintained momentum in my <strong>Duolingo and Sololearn</strong> endeavors, consistently logging over 112 days. I remain hopeful to find a study buddy to join me on this language learning journey.</p>
              <p>Thank you for joining me on this update, and I look forward to sharing more soon.</p>

      <div class="box" style="text-align: left;"><p><strong>This week, I created my video resume to aid in my job search. You can locate it <a href="https://youtu.be/zMxFDNEymnk" style="font-weight: bold; color: #0062b9;" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong></p>
      <p>Welcome back, everyone, to the weekly blog. I'm glad you returned to read, but I must admit, not much happened this week.</p>
      <p>In brief, I was only able to study for three out of the seven days in the previous week due to both a great and unfortunate event. The great thing was that our home was visited by my brother-in-law. We spent the days introducing him to our city and discussing family matters. Unfortunately, right after he returned, I was struck by fever.</p>
      <p>Regarding my <strong>ENCOR</strong> progress, I reached Chapter 8, which involved a deep dive into <strong>OSPF</strong>.</p>
      <p>On a positive note, I successfully completed a streak of over 100 days on both <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> and <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/">SoloLearn</a>.</p>
      <p>I have been absent for the past few days. Please keep me in your prayers for my well-being.</p>

      <div class="box" style="text-align: left;"><p>Greetings for the new week,</p>
      <p>With hope and well wishes for continued success, I trust that everyone has had a productive week thus far. Time seems to have flown by rapidly, perhaps due to being deeply engrossed in our established routines without a moment to pause and reflect.</p>
      <p>Reflecting on the past week, the prevalence of layoffs has been noticeable. It's disheartening to witness numerous posts on LinkedIn regarding talented individuals losing their positions.</p>
      <p>However, amidst the challenges, there are also moments of optimism to be found.</p>
      <p>On a brighter note, <strong>OpenAI</strong> recently launched an impressive text-to-video generator capable of producing one-minute videos—a perfect fit for today's short attention spans, especially among Gen Z.</p>
      <p>As for my own endeavors, I've embarked on a new writing approach this week, posing questions to myself as a reader might. I believe this tactic enhances the fluency of my writing and improves readability. I encourage feedback on this new style via my social media handle, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%40harshvermac5&sca_esv=53fc82b34e85f072&sxsrf=ACQVn08f-V37vbXCpJ0idPJRDzc32amp8w:1708257219620&filter=0&biw=1358&bih=664&dpr=1" style="font-weight: bold; color: #0062b9;" target="_blank">@harshvermac5</a>.</p>
      <p>Regarding projects, I've successfully tackled challenges 111 to 150 in the <strong>"Python By Example"</strong> book, focusing on more complex tasks involving <strong>tkinter</strong> for GUI development—an area I've always found intriguing. Additionally, I've completed the <strong>"Packet Capture"</strong> course using Wireshark by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidbombal/" style="font-weight: bold; color: #0062b9;" target="_blank">David Bombal<a/>, with plans to delve into CCNP preparations and share lecture flashcards following Sir <strong>Jeremy McDowell's</strong> approach.</p>
      <p>While I haven't yet fulfilled my promise of sharing Packet Tracer labs, it remains a priority for me. I've also completed the SQL introduction course on <strong>SoloLearn</strong> and enrolled in the intermediate level—a necessary step to enhance the functionality of various websites.</p>
      <p>That concludes the updates for this week. Until next time, take care and stay tuned for further developments.</p>

      <p>Hello everyone,</p>
      <p>I hope you are all doing well and having a great week. Once again, I extend a warm welcome to join me on my technical journey.</p>
      <p>Starting with some good news, I have recently completed the <strong>"AI for Everyone"</strong> course by <strong>Andrew Ng</strong> on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone?utm_source=deeplearningai&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=WebsiteCoursesAI4ETopButton" style="font-weight: bold; color: #0062b9;" >Coursera</a>. I have also signed up for their newsletter. It's wonderful to stay connected with such an influential figure. The best part is, you can audit the course for free, although assessments are not accessible. Nonetheless, I am excited to share my notes on LinkedIn. I've attached screenshots of answers for verification. You can view the post <a href="link">here</a> and consider reposting if you find it valuable, to help it reach more people.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I am approximately one-fifth of the way through the <strong>"Packet Capture"</strong> course using Wireshark by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidbombal/" style="font-weight: bold; color: #0062b9;">David Bombal<a/>. I am thrilled with how smoothly I am progressing through the troubleshooting labs. It seems my preparation for CCNA is paying off. I can't wait to share more details once I complete the course.</p>
      <p>For the first time, I posted an infographic on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/harshvermac5_demilitarized-zone-activity-7162028121020452864-VjcR?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop"style="font-weight: bold; color: #0062b9;">LinkedIn</a>, focusing on <strong>DMZ</strong> (Demilitarized Zone). Just to recap, it serves as a security buffer between public and private networks, safeguarding the critical inside network from external threats, such as the Internet. I'm delighted that it received positive feedback from my connections. Stay tuned, as I plan to share more infographics soon. <strong>*SPOILER ALERT*</strong> Next, I'll be posting an infographic about Honeypots in the network.</p>
      <p>I would love to hear from you too. Feel free to connect and share with me. Your contributions are greatly appreciated.</p>

      </label>
      <div class="box" style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Hello, fantastic readers! 🌟<p>
      </p> What a ride this week has been, and I'm thrilled to have you join me on this journey.</p>
      <p>So, my week kicked off with a deep dive into a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/wireshark-packet-analysis-and-ethical-hacking-core-skills/learn/lecture/15144294?start=0#announcements"style="font-weight: bold; color: #0062b9;"><strong>course on network analysis using Wireshark</strong></a> – blame it on that persistent Temptation. Thanks to Sir <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@davidbombal" style="font-weight: bold; color: #0062b9;"><strong>David Bombal's YouTube channel</strong></a>, I stumbled upon Udemy coupon codes and snagged a Wireshark course, possibly for free! There, I learned about two kinds of filters that Wireshark offers: one for capturing the traffic and the other for scrutinizing it. And voila, it also comes with a filtered traffic follow mode, showing all the related traffic at one place at once.</p>
      <p>Let's talk coding adventures! Curiosity struck again, leading me to the <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/en/learn/courses/sql-introduction" style="font-weight: bold; color: #0062b9;"><strong>SoloLearn</strong></a> app for a date with <strong>SQL</strong>. After mastering Python, SQL feels like a breeze, and I'm eagerly awaiting the day I can seamlessly blend the two. This website also needs a breeze of SQL too.</p>
      <p>Moreover, <strong>GitHub</strong> became my creative playground. I created a new repository – <strong>Python by Example challenges</strong>. This is based on the challenges found in the book "<strong>Python by Example</strong>" by Nichola Lacey. I know the book has the solutions, but I enjoy solving them on my own; you can check out my progress and code by <a href="https://github.com/harshvermac5/python-by-example" style="font-weight: bold; color: #0062b9;">clicking <strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
      <p>From Feb 1 onwards, I also started to look for jobs on <strong>LinkedIn</strong> with a target of at least 2-3 applications per day. I duly follow the words of Sir Ankur Wariko, "<strong>Cold Emailing</strong>": Whenever possible, I try to connect with the recruiter. This has paid off great so far. Now I have connections with most of my CCNA tutors. Last night, I got connected with a Python developer who has created an impressive image recognition project; you can also follow and connect with him <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/khushank73/" style="font-weight: bold; color: #0062b9;"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
      <p>In my job search hustle, I took advice from Sir Jeff Su, which was making a <strong>targeted resume with the help of gpt-Prompt</strong>. This help alone is miraculous, and when backed by all the effort I put into improving myself, it seems great. He duly warned me to check for the hallucinations the chat GPT makes, so I check my resume twice before posting. If any recruiter reading this post, please reach out to me at my email. I will be glad and totally open to work as a <strong>Junior Network Engineer or as a Network Technician</strong> for your firm.</p>
      <p>All good so far, but the Temptation also brings the anxiety of starting too much at once but completing none. For this also, I made a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/harshvermac5_achievefocus-fromchaostocalm-lifewisdom-activity-7159273283018776576-Iiy9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop" style="font-weight: bold; color: #0062b9;"><strong>LinkedIn</strong></a> expressing the need to cope with this scenario. One thing more I want to share: since I started to listen to <strong>classical music</strong>, the majority of my anxiety fades away. Do try this trick and tell me, does it also work for you?</p>
      <p>Now, time to talk about the plans for the future. I am planning to start posting some <strong>Cisco Packet Tracer labs on GitHub</strong>, but I am limiting myself until I finish every challenge in the <strong>Python-by-Example</strong> book. I have a plan to make the labs so polished that no one needs to buy any premium things to pass <strong>CCNA</strong>. I will try to match the quality of labs to those questions asked in the exam. 🚀 #WeeklyUpdate #LearningJourney #TechAdventures</p>

      </p>
      <p>
      This incredible project commenced two weeks ago and has now reached a near-completion stage. If you encounter any glitches, your feedback is highly valued; feel free to reach out via email or messaging on any available platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
      Reflecting on this journey, memories of my attempts to create a website during my Intermediate years, nearly 4-5 years ago, come to mind. Those early endeavors ended in failure, but today, with the support of friends and the ever-evolving user-friendly technology, achieving wonders like this website is within everyone's grasp. Gratitude for progress, growth, and the collaborative spirit that makes such accomplishments possible. Explore my works on my GitHub page, and thank you for being part of this journey.

        <p >
        As you may know, I'm preparing for the <strong>CCNA examination</strong>, which is a certification that validates my knowledge and skills in <strong>network engineering</strong> and <strong>security</strong>. It's a tough exam, but I'm determined to ace it.
        </p>
        <p >
        One of the ways I'm studying for the exam is by creating <strong>YouTube videos</strong>, mainly audio form recordings, where I explain the concepts and topics covered in the <strong>CCNA syllabus</strong>. I have a passion for sharing educational content with you all, and I believe that teaching is the best way to learn.
        </p>
        <p >
        I was inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyzf9_LUFN-2Xr30z8hyW1A" style="font-weight: bold; color: #0062b9;"><strong>Puneet Biseria</strong></a> who is a great teacher and a mentor for me. He once said that you only grasp a hold of something if you are able to teach others. That resonated with me, and I decided to follow his advice.
        </p>
        <p >
        I have a target of creating a set of 12 videos, covering the main domains of the <strong>CCNA exam</strong>. You can find them on my YouTube playlist for <strong>CCNA</strong>. I'm currently on the fourth video, where I talk about <strong>network access</strong> and <strong>security</strong>.
        </p>
        <p >
        I know that the audio quality is not very good on the first few videos, but I hope you can bear with me. I'm still learning how to use the software and the microphone, and I'm trying to improve with each video. I appreciate your feedback and suggestions on how to make my videos better.
        </p>
        <p >
        I'm also aware that it was the end of the year when I started this project, and everyone was celebrating the new year. But I was so focused on my goal that I didn't mind spending hours on my computer, recording and editing my videos. I had a mixed feeling of happiness and tension, as I was excited about sharing my knowledge with you, but also nervous about the upcoming exam.
        </p>
        <p >
        I did make a special video, where I greeted you and wished you a <strong>happy new year</strong>. You can watch it <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/eUZSuhANzwo?feature=share" style="font-weight: bold; color: #0062b9;"><strong>here</strong>.</a> I hope you enjoyed it and felt my gratitude and appreciation for your support and encouragement.
        </p>
        <p >
        That's all for today. Thank you for reading my blog and watching my videos. I hope you learned something new and useful from them. I would love to hear from you! Your thoughts and feedback help me grow and improve my blog and my videos. Please share your comments below.
        </p>
        <p >
        See you next week, when I'll update you on my fifth video and my exam preparation. Until then, stay safe and keep learning!
